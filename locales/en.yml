    errors:
      admin_required: |-
        The Hyper-V provider requires that Vagrant be run with
        administrative privileges. This is a limitation of Hyper-V itself.
        Hyper-V requires administrative privileges for management
        commands. Please restart your console with administrative
        privileges and try again.
      ip_addr_timeout: |-
        Hyper-V failed to determine your machine's IP address within the
        configured timeout. Please verify the machine properly booted and
        the network works. To do this, open the Hyper-V manager, find your
        virtual machine, and connect to it.

        The most common cause for this error is that the running virtual
        machine doesn't have the latest Hyper-V integration drivers. Please
        research for your operating system how to install these in order
        for the VM to properly communicate its IP address to Hyper-V.
      powershell_features_disabled: |-
        The Hyper-V cmdlets for PowerShell are not available! Vagrant
        requires these to control Hyper-V. Please enable them in the
        "Windows Features" control panel and try again.
      powershell_error: |-
        An error occurred while executing a PowerShell script. This error
        is shown below. Please read the error message and see if this is
        a configuration error with your system. If it is not, then please
        report a bug.

      powershell_required: |-
        The Vagrant Hyper-V provider requires PowerShell to be available.
        Please make sure "powershell.exe" is available on your PATH.
      windows_required: |-
        The Hyper-V provider only works on Windows. Please try to
        use another provider.
